# Running Shoe Image Classifier

## Overview

A site I created as the final model deployment step in an end-to-end computer imaging project. An opportunity to practice front-end development as well as working with the Flask microframework. Data collection, pre-processing and modeling steps available at [this repo]().

## Background and Motivation

As a former shoe retailer, I found that customers often found it difficult to identify particular running shoes based on the the logo and other external features. This was especially true for more niche brands. The current project aims to allow users to either take a photo or upload an image of a running shoe to the web application and have it idenfified.

To enhance the functionality, I plan to source independent shoe store retailers and other online resources to identify the particular shoe name and other relevant running shoe features.

## Goals

1. Deploy a web application and model for image classification.
2. Add functionality for indentification of specific shoe
3. Add functionality for specific shoe features
4. Add recommendation functionallity for other shoes the use might like

## Practical Applications

- Useful for customers and retailers looking to gain more information about a particular shoe
